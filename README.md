  a simple biliard game with only one ball!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
  the most important goal of this project was to implement real physics when we hit a ball in a biliard table.
  <br />
  <br />
  

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <img width="100%" src="images/screen1.PNG" alt="screenshot 1">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

## About The Code
#### libraries
&ensp; tkinter for graphics
<br />
&ensp; math for applying physics to the game
<br />
#### logic
&ensp;  in terminal velocity and angle are gotten (the velocity unit is cm/80ms because our board is updated each 80 ms 
<br />
&ensp;  and the angle start from left to right) and the position of the ball is updated every 80 ms based on the input
<br />
&ensp; velocity and angle in drowO function, after that the velocity is updated based on either it is just moving on
<br />
&ensp; the board or is hit by the table edges.
